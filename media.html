<h2>How does the news cycle work during a campaign?</h2>

    <p class="siteparagraph">As mentioned in Ryan Holiday’s book, <span class="italic">Trust Me I’m Lying</span>, during election periods, traffic on news sites goes up. Since they have infinite space to fill and need to keep publishing, a lot more information than necessary can get produced. This is great for anyone seeking to convey a message, like a political candidate.
While the traditional role of the media is to inform the public so they can participate in a democracy, when it comes to news during a campaign, less is more. Follow less breaking news and be patient with developing stories. Consider alternative perspectives and what the motive of a source is. Moreover, ask yourself why the information you’re getting matters to begin with.</p>

<p class="siteparagraph">While debates, town halls and all-candidate forums can tell you a lot about the people running and are great theatre, watch enough of them during an election campaign and you’ll notice a common thread: messages keep repeating and few real answers are given. And if candidates say anything interesting, it’s usually so someone in the media will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2O4FisQbKw" target="_blank">mention</a> it. The quickest way to see where a party or its candidates stand is their campaign literature, specifically the platform.

<h2>What about fake news?</h2>
<p class="siteparagraph">This became a major issue during the 2016 United States Presidential election, as it was said this and external tampering on social media may have influenced the result. The best remedy of course it to rely on reputable news sources. Here’s a list of those outlets:</p>
